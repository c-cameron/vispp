# VISPP

This repository contains visualizations I use for analysis / some papers. These are the abstract functions that should
be generally applicable to any data frames. For more in-depth explanations please refer to the respective functions. 

## Installation

If you have `make` installed, setup the virtual environment using:

```
make venv
```

## Examples

There are some example scripts that plot random / fantasy data under `examples/`. Before you run any of these please
activate the virtual environment using:

```
source vispp_venv/bin/activate
```
